# upm-package-template-3DLightweight

This template is a good starting point for developers focused on performance and projects that use a primarily baked lighting solution. This template utilizes the Lightweight Scriptable Render Pipeline, which is a single-pass forward renderer. Using the Lightweight pipeline will decrease the draw call count on your project making it an ideal solution for lower-end hardware.

This project also includes the new shader graph tool. This tool allows users to create shaders using a visual node editor instead of writing code. Read more about the shader graph here:

This project also includes the new Post-Processing stack, several presets to jump start development, and example content. To learn more about Post-Processing please refer to the wiki page located here:
